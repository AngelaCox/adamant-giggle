This is a docs project in which I am researching and learning about different workflows for publishing documentation.

As a technical writer, the expectation is that I must understand the various ways that developers expect documentation to be created and maintained, and this is one way that I do that. 

I'm creating workflows, working with the following tools:
Travis CL, GitHub, Publican, Atom, ReadTheDocs and a few more.

I hope to contribute to a few more opensource projects over the next 12 months.
