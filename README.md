This is a docs project in which I am researching and learning about different workflows for publishing documentation.

As a technical writer, the expectation is that I must understand the various ways that developers expect documentation to be created and maintained, and this is one way that I do that. 

I'm creating workflows, working with the following tools:
Travis CL, GitHub, Publican, Atom, ReadTheDocs and a few more.

I hope to contribute to a few more opensource projects over the next 12 months.

It looks like I'm neglecting this project as am working from Bitbucket on a portfolio website (https://angportfolio.aerobatic.io/). 


Current tools are Bitbucket (with aerobatic), Atom (and markdownpad two) and GitKraken. Might have to move away from GitKraken for a bit until they fix their issues with pulling. 

Currently learning more about CSS and hope to be able to implement further changes in this project once I'm finished!
